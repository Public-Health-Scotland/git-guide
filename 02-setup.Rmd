# Setup {-}

Knowing where to start, or how to be confident in your configuration is likely the best place to start. If something changes in the future, like getting a new device, or starting to use a new account, it'll hopefully be useful to have a reference to check back on.

In this section, each component has it's own section for setup, check them out:

* [Git](#git-setup)
* [GitHub](#github-setup)
* [Gitea](#gitea-setup)
* [RStudio](#rstudio-setup)
* [VS Code](#vs-code-setup)

## Git Setup {-}

*These instructions should only need to be followed once or when setting up a new device.*

1. **Install Git** - *This step is only necessary if you will be working with Git local to your machine, e.g. not on the Posit Workbench server.* Git is a free, open-source, software available from https://git-scm.com/. If you work within PHS, request the software from IT through [Service Now](https://nhsnss.service-now.com/phs/). Once authorised, this will allow you to download it from the Software Center on your machine. 

    This will install three applications on your computer, go to Start > Git (folder):

    * **Git Bash** - this is the command line (Shell) interface for Git. This will allow you to enter Git commands, i.e. `git init`, and can be launched by right clicking in a directory/folder and selecting "Git Bash Here".
    * **Git CMD** - this is a deprecated version, similar to the Bash interface, and shouldn't be used here.
    * **Git GUI** - this is Git's version of a Graphical User Interface. This will perform the same functions as "Git Bash", but employs a point-and-click interface instead. This guide does not cover Git GUI and instead focuses on the integrated Git GUI in RStudio.

2. **Configure your details** - Git needs to know who you are, use the following commands to configure your username and email using Git Bash or the Terminal (*if you're a GitHub user, use the same email and username you're registered with on GitHub.* This is a necessary step for GitHub to recognise the account where the commits come from, even with proper authentication GitHub will use these details to assign the commits.) Remember not to type the arrow symbols `<>` when entering the command:

* `git config --global user.email <email address>` - use your PHS email address here.
* `git config --global user.name <your name>` - use your GitHub username here, see [GitHub Setup](#github-setup) for more details.

    At any time you can check what the current user details are using:

* `git config --global user.email`

\newpage
## GitHub Setup {-}

These instructions are for first-time users of GitHub and highlight the steps in setting up a GitHub account.

1. **Sign up** - In order to use GitHub, you'll need to have a personal GitHub account, you can set that up on the [GitHub website](http://github.com/signup). If using your PHS email address or LDAP username ensure you **don't use the same password as your email account or LDAP login**. 

2. **Edit your details** - you will be able to set these items up as part of the sign up process. Otherwise, follow the links and edit them now.

* Go to your [Profile Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and add your details with a picture of yourself if you feel comfortable to do so.
* Go to your [Account Settings](https://github.com/settings/admin) and make sure your username is set to be your name (or something more recognisable). This helps to identify users as generated GitHub handles tend to pretty obscure.

3. **Get added to Organisations** - this step is optional.

* If you work within Public Health Scotland, the [Public Health Scotland GitHub organisation](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland)may be of interest. Email [phs.datascience@phs.scot](mailto:phs.datascience@phs.scot) to be added to the organisation. You'll then be able to create shared repos or teams.

\newpage
## Gitea Setup {-}

There's pretty much nothing for you to do here. The Gitea server is linked with LDAP and you can access Gitea here: https://phs-git.nhsnss.scot.nhs.uk/ - just log in with your usual LDAP username and password.

If you require an 'organisation' (team) set up or have other queries about Gitea accounts, email [phs.datascience@phs.scot](mailto:phs.datascience@phs.scot).

\newpage
## RStudio Setup {-}

There are 2 primary versions of RStudio available for staff in PHS, a local version on your machine and as an IDE on the [Posit Workbench server](https://pwb.publichealthscotland.org/). If your working on your local machine, first [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) must be installed. Just as with Git, if you work within PHS, these can be requested through [Service Now](https://nhsnss.service-now.com/phs/). Once authorised, this will allow you to download it from the Software Center on your machine. Most use cases will be for the server but getting Git setup on RStudio is the same regardless of where you're using it.

1. **Once in RStudio, go to Tools in the menu bar > Global Options > Git/SVN**:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '95%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rstudio-globalopt-gitsvn.png', dpi = NA)
```
&nbsp;

2. **If "Git executable:" shows "*(none)*", click "Browse" and select the Git executable installed on your system.** - That's it for attaching RStudio and Git. This will allow you to utilise the RStudio Git GUI tools inside R Projects. 

    * On Windows - the file path should point to folder Git was installed to and finish `.../bin/git.exe`. 
    * On the server - the path should be `/usr/bin/git`.

### Authentication for remotes {-}

Authentication is required to work with Git remotes, e.g., GitHub. Gitea uses HTTPS authentication, with SSH not available, and accepts your standard LDAP username and password. As such, there is no setup required for Gitea. 

* **Create an SSH Key** - this is the recommended authentication method on the new server, as a faster and more convenient method.

    1. If you see anything within the 'SSH RSA Key:' box, you can skip this step, else click on 'Create RSA Key...', click 'Create' and close the dialog box that appears confirming the key creation.
    2. Now, click on 'View public key' and copy the text string that appears in a dialog box. 
    3. Go to your [GitHub SSH Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) and click 'New SSH key'.
    4. Give the key a meaningful title that you will recongnise (e.g. "Posit Workbench") and paste the key from RStudio. Complete the process by clicking 'Add SSH key'.

&nbsp;

* **Use HTTPS on GitHub** - GitHub blocked plain HTTPS authentication due to security concerns, and as such now requires a PAT. While SSH is now available (and the preferred option), details are below for how to use:

    1. Create a PAT - Go to your [GitHub Personal Access Tokens’ settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens), create a token (with a meaningful name), and grant the necessary permissions (likely to be all of 'repo'). Then, copy the given token to your clipboard. *Note: for security, after you leave the page, you will no longer be able to retrieve the token.*
    2. Use the PAT - the PAT will be used in place of your password when performing secure operations over HTTPS. It is possible to store the PAT rather than having to enter for every operation:
        1. If you already have cached these details or have made an error, clear the cache by entering this command in the terminal:
        
            `git config --global -–unset credential.helper`
        
        2. Then enter this command in the terminal. After performing a Git operation, you will be asked to enter your credentials. Make sure to use your usual GitHub username and the PAT. Following this, your credentials should be stored for future Git operations. 
        
            `git config --global credential.helper store`
