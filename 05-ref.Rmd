### Top Tips {-}

These are some tips/references to keep in mind when working with git:

* Although it's good to use version control throughout a project, Git can be initialised on an existing project folder.
* Commit often. Commits are the project history so commit after a section of code is completed, before lunch, at the end of the day, etc.
* [Write good commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages). The messages should be succinct, meaningful, and written in imperative form (i.e. "Add x, y, z" not "Added x, y, z").
* Delete branches after merging. This reduces risks of merge conflicts and keeps your work set-up tidy.
* It's possible to have multiple branches for working on or fixing multiple features of your project, but be aware that this increases the chance of a merge conflict.

> <span style="color:red">GitHub should be thought of as a public forum. No confidential information (including server connection details, passwords, and person identifiable information) should be pushed, even to a private repository! Keep this in mind throughout any project, it's easier to maintain security throughout than have to go back through and delete code or commits later.</span>

And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system."*
