> <span style="color:red">GitHub should be thought of as a public forum. No confidential information (including server connection details, passwords, and person identifiable information) should be pushed, even to a private repository! Keep this in mind throughout any project, it's easier to maintain security throughout than have to go back through and delete code or commits later.</span>
